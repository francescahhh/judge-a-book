# judge-a-book
Project Pitch: 
I drew inspiration for this app from a “Bookstagram” account I follow on Instagram, @daciandthepencil. The account owner did a series of reels where she guessed what books were about based only on the cover, and I thought that would be a fun/different idea for an app since I am someone who usually considers the cover of a book as sort of a last priority when book shopping. 

Using data from the Penguin Random House Rest Services API, “Judging a Book by its Cover” is an application that displays the cover image, title, and author of selected new release books, but not any of the details about the story. This app allows the user to “like” the covers that they find the most aesthetically pleasing/interesting. Judging a Book by its Cover also allows the user to add a comment below the image of the book with their guess for what the book is about based on the cover image. [Stretch deliverable: After submitting, the app will display the actual summary of the book from the API data.]

User Stories: 
--As a user, I should be able to view the image, title, and author information for six books. 
--As a user, I should be able to click a “like” button associated with each book so that I can view which books I liked. 
--As a user, I should be able to submit a form so I can add a comment with my guess for what the book is about based on the cover image. 
-Stretch Deliverable: 
--As a user, I should be able to view an alert that displays the summary from the book flap (flapcopy data).
